# Susann-Orosco-Portfolio

## Description

In this challenge, I was assigned to create a professional portfolio to showcase my skills. I was given no starter code this time, and I created the website from scratch based on a template scroll video. 

## Table of Contents 

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

- [Portfolio Requirements](#portfolio-requirements)
- [Screenshot Video](#screenshot-video)
- [Link To Deployed Portfolio](#link-to-deployed-portfolio)

## Portfolio Requirements

- A fully displayed portfolio website
- Developers name, contact info, work and links to work-projects, image of developer
- Navigation links pointing to corresponding sections on website
- First work display to be a larger sized image
- By clicking the image the user is taken to deployed application
- A responsive layout is applied to different screen sizes

CREDIT NOTES: SlackBot AskBCS Javier @japb1998 helped me with alignment of flexbox elements: alignment of 4 lower containers with bigger upper container,margin between all containers and positioning.

## Screenshot Video

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative file path, add it to your README using the following syntax:
